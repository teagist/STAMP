# Student/Tutor Appointment Management Program (STAMP)

STAMP is an expansion of my senior project from college.  This system supports a server that a command line interface, website, and desktop application interface with.  This system supports different users with differing functionality for each.  


## Command Line Interface
The command line interface for STAMP is a solution for users that prefer to not use a GUI for everything.  The goal is to create an interface that supports commands that feel natural to command line users while allowing them to fully use the system.

## Desktop Application
The Desktop application will provide a more visual experience to the user.  This application will attempt to make use of several UI design principles.  

## Website 
At this time the web interface will need some more investigation into, in order to develop the best solution.
